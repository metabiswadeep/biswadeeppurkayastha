# About Me

I am an undergrad student at IIT Mandi. I enjoyed exploring various domains in Computer Science such as Cross-platform development, Front-End Development, Computer Vision, Scientific computing, Data Science and Open-Source.

I had a great interest for astronomy since my childhood that eventually helped me to get selected as a GSoC student at OpenAstronomy. I was a Coordinator of the Space Technology and Astronomy Cell of my college and was responsible for organizing various events and sessions. I have represented my school and college at various competitions. I love starting new things and building solutions for real-life problems.
